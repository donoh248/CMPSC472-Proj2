# CMPSC472-Proj2
CMPSC472 Project 2 for Spring 2024 by Zachary Whitaker and Donovan Biedermann

## Project goals
The main goal of this project is to create a program using material we learned in class to address drug abuse. We aim to make the user more aware of the medical facts of each major abusive drug and how to effects someone so that in the future, symptoms of addiction or abuse can be easier to identify and treatment can be administered faster.

## Significance of the project
The significance of this project is the access to a collective knowledgebase to quickly identify and learn about various drugs. This application has compiled a substantial list of websites on drug information for the user to search and educate themselves on.
